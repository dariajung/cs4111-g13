Parts of Part1 Proposal Implemented
-------------------------------------
- Built searching application that allows user to view how campaign finance money affects legislation and law.
- user will view receipts of money from large industries to senators and representatives using PACs, and then view how politicians voted on legislation related to those industries (to see if campaign donations affected their vote)
- application allows users to use search criteria such as: politician name, state, cause, legislation, type of organization (Super PAC, PAC), amount of money given, etc 
- added demographic search where user can see the political leanings of politicians based on their represented state's or district's diversity (percentage of population which is minority)
